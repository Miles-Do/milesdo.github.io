     The fourth wall refers to the fourth invisible wall separating an audience from a media piece. While originating in theatre it is now referred to within television, film and literature as well as video games. By breaking this wall the narrative piece will in some way acknowledge its own fictional state often by directly or indirectly conversing with an audience. While theatre [3] and cinema have on occasion broken the fourth wall through physical audience interaction, fundamentally video games’ interactivity is what sets it apart when utilising fourth wall techniques;


Video games are increasingly allowing players to direct the course of a narrative through the characters’ decision making. This can be seen within alternate storylines, endings which in some cases can be so extreme as to determine the fate of the main protagonist.. [31] It is often felt this degree of control can make it harder to immerse players as they’re continually aware of the fictional nature of the media which they have control over.

Fourth Wall Techniques

Fourth wall breaking has commonly been used in games since the early 1990s. More importantly however the medium has shown from a very early stage how its interactivity can allow it to utilise fourth wall techniques in new and engaging gameplay experiences.
